## 4.1 Test Automation Development

### 4.1.1 Apply Guidelines that Support Effective Test Automation Pilot and Deployment Activities

A **test automation pilot** helps validate the approach, tools, and environment before full implementation. Although pilots are short, they can influence the entire automation strategy.

To define a pilot, the following should be evaluated:
- Programming language to be used.

- Tools (commercial/open-source) suitable for the project.

- Test levels to be covered.

- Representative test cases to automate.

- Test development strategy or approach.

After defining the above, TAEs can create **initial prototypes** to evaluate pros and cons. Based on this, they can decide which strategy to implement.

- Define a clear **timeline** and **review progress regularly** to catch risks early.

- Try to **integrate the TAS into CI/CD** as soon as possible.

- Evaluate **non-technical factors** like:
  - Team experience, knowledge and structure.

  - Licensing and organization rules.
  
  - Types of tests and test levels planned.

Once the pilot ends, **TAEs and test managers** must review results and decide how to proceed.

## 4.2 Risks Associated with Test Automation Development

### 4.2.1 Analyze Deployment Risks and Plan Mitigation Strategies for Test Automation

During the implementation of the pilot, expansion and maintenance of the test automation code needs to be considered.

Risk analysis must be done **before** and **during** deployment to avoid issues that can affect automation quality or test reliability.

### Different deployment risks can be identified from the pilot:
- **Firewall configurations**. (openings, issues)

- **Resource constraints** (e.g., CPU, RAM).

- **Network reliability**. (TAEs needs to ensure that all conditions are met to provide quality gates in their dev process.)

- **Test device setup** (especially for mobile testing — power, battery, network connection and SUT access).

### Technical deployment risks:
| Risk Type | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Packaging** | Testware must be versioned and shared (e.g., Git, cloud repositories). |
| **Logging** | Gives most of the information about test results that must be detailed and categorized using levels like:<ul><li>`Fatal`: Error events that may lead to test execution aborts.<li>`Error`: Condition/interaction fails leading to test case failure.<li>`Warn`: Unexpected condition/action occurs but doesn’t fail the test.<li>`Info`: Basic test run information.<li>`Debug`: For test failure investigations.<li>`Trace`: Even more detailed than debug.</ul> |
| **Test Structuring** | Test harness and fixtures must support automation. Fixtures set up data, environments, pre/post conditions, and allow grouping test suites. |
| **Updating** | Tools, agents, or devices can auto-update. Mitigate this with strict configuration plans and version control. |

Risk management helps maintain **reliable quality gates** in automation pipelines.

## 4.3 Test Automation Solution Maintainability

### 4.3.1 Explain Which Factors Support and Affect Test Automation Solution Maintainability

Maintainability depends on **code quality**, team practices, and proper setup, we can follow **clean code principles** (from Robert C. Martin’s *Clean Code*).

### Clean Code principles:

| Best Practice | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Consistent naming** | Use meaningful names for classes, methods and variables. (e.g., `loginButton`, `resetPasswordButton`). |
| **Organized structure** | Maintain logical and common project structure. |
| **Avoid hardcoding** | Use external data sources or constants to manage test data. |
| **Limit method inputs** | Fewer parameters improve readability and maintainability. |
| **Avoid complex methods** | Break logic into smaller, reusable parts. |
| **Use logging** | Helps with test failure analysis. |
| **Apply design patterns** | Reuse proven architecture models (see Chapter 3). |
| **Focus on testability** | Write automation with easy configuration, clear dependencies, and reusable logic. |

Additional practices:
- Use **static analyzers** and **code formatters** for readability.

- Follow **version control branching strategies**:
  - Separate branches for features, releases, and defect fixes.

These practices make the TAS easier to scale, debug, and evolve over time.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- Pilot projects validate approaches and tools before scaling test automation.
- Deployment introduces risks technical and non-technical that must be planned and mitigated.
- Logging, packaging, and test structure are crucial for stable automation.
- Maintainability depends on clean code, patterns, project structure, and tooling.
- Design principles, static analysis, and clear conventions improve long-term quality and collaboration.
