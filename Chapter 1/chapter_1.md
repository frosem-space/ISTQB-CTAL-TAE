## 1.1 Purpose of Test Automation

Test automation involves the use of software to support or perform testing tasks such as:

- Configuring and controlling test execution
- Automatically executing tests
- Comparing actual vs. expected results

Automation supports testing across a wide range of systems under test (SUT) including UI-based apps, APIs, mobile, and embedded systems.

### Advantages of Test Automation

Test automation delivers value by:
- **Increased test coverage per build**: More tests can be run frequently and consistently.
- **Execution of complex or time-sensitive tests**: Enables parallel, real-time, or remote testing.
- **Faster feedback**: Detect defects early and reduce time-to-release.
- **Reduced human error**: Automated scripts execute exactly as defined.
- **Efficient resource usage**: More effective allocation of testing efforts.
- **Enhanced reliability and consistency**: Same tests, same execution, every time.
- **Support for CI/CD**: Integrates easily with modern pipelines to maintain product quality.
- **Improved test reuse and maintainability**: Frameworks support long-term scalability.

### Disadvantages and Limitations

However, automation also has challenges:
- **Initial investment**: Setup costs for tools, infrastructure, hire a TAE, and set up training.
- **Maintenance overhead**: Scripts must be updated when the SUT changes.
- **Skill requirements**: Often requires skilled automation engineers.
- **Risk of rigidity**: Automated tests may break with minor UI or logic changes.
- **Automation blindness**: Automation can only check what it’s explicitly coded to verify.
- **Additional defects**: Failed executions of automated test cases creates new defects when the SUT changes requirements.
- **Not universally applicable**: Some test types (e.g., usability or exploratory testing) require human judgment.

Limitations to be aware of:
- Not all manual tests are suitable for automation.
- Verifying only what automated tests are programmed to do.
- Can only check test results that can be verified by an automated test oracle.
- Some quality attributes (like user satisfaction) are difficult or impossible to automate.

## 1.2 Test Automation in the Software Development Lifecycle

Test automation can be used across various SDLC models, but how it's applied depends on the lifecycle structure.

### 1.2.1 Explain How Test Automation is Applied Across Different Software Development Lifecycle Models

#### Waterfall Model
- Automation typically starts **after** implementation.
- Tests are executed during the **verification phase**.
- Challenges include late feedback and delayed automation benefits.

#### V-Model
- Allows for **early planning** of test automation per test level (**CTFL**, [Section 2.2](https://www.istqb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf#page=28)).
- A TAF (Test Automation Framework) can be designed to support each test level.
- Promotes traceability and structured test development.

#### Agile software development
- Emphasizes collaboration between TAEs and business stakeholders
- Encourages in-sprint automation
- Supports continuous testing through:
  - Pair programming
  - Frequent code reviews
  - Automated regression testing

Automation is integrated into iterative cycles, supporting fast feedback and adaptive planning, more insights on Agile automation can be found in the **CT-TAS**, [Section 3.2](https://www.istqb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ISTQB_CT-TAS_Syllabus_v1.0.pdf#page=25).

### 1.2.2 Select Suitable Test Automation Tools For a Given System Under Test

Choosing the right tool requires understanding both the project and team context.

**Key considerations include:**

1. **System Under Test (SUT) characteristics**:
   - UI-based, API-based, embedded, etc.
   - Technologies involved (e.g., web, mobile, protocols).

2. **Project Requirements**:
   - Scope and goals of testing.
   - Required integrations and delivery timeline.

3. **Team skills**:
   - Low-code/no-code tools may be needed for non-technical testers.
   - Language compatibility with the development stack can enhance collaboration and debugging.

4. **Tool capabilities**:
   - Recording vs. scripting.
   - Integration with CI/CD.
   - Support for reporting and analytics.
   - Extensibility and maintainability.

5. **Cost and licensing**:
   - Open-source vs. commercial.
   - Long-term sustainability and support.

**Tool selection should be iterative**, based on trials and evaluations. The best tool is one that fits both the project goals and the team’s technical capabilities.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- Test automation provides speed, consistency, and scalability, but requires planning and investment.
- Benefits are maximized when automation is aligned with the SDLC model and project context.
- Not all testing can or should be automated.
- Tool selection must consider the SUT, team skills, project goals, and long-term maintainability.

> ✅ **Test automation is not just about tools or speed**, it's about building confidence in product quality, enabling faster delivery, and supporting change.
---
> ⚠️ Not all tools are equally effective across projects. The right choice considers technical needs, team skill sets, and future roadmap goals.
