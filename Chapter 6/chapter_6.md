## 6.1 Collection, Analysis and Reporting of Test Automation Data

### 6.1.1 Apply Data Collection Methods from the Test Automation Solution and the System Under Test

Data can be collected from different sources to support defect analysis and trend monitoring.

#### Data sources include:
- **SUT logs** (UI, APIs, application servers, DB servers)
- **TAF logs** (audit trails of test execution)
- **Build, deployment, and production logs** 
- **Screenshots or screen recordings**
- **Performance logs** (e.g., load, stress and spike test results)

Test automation tools should support enhancements to log start/end times, test steps, execution counters, and runtime data like memory usage. Assertions are used to compare actual and expected results. Reporting should handle acceptable differences (e.g., timestamps) and focus on unexpected ones.

#### Types of logs and information captured:

| Area | Logging Examples |
|------|------------------|
| **TAF / TAS** | Test case ID, status (pass, fail, TAS error), test step timing, random data, screenshots, crash dumps, and stack traces. |
| **SUT** | Defect timestamps, configurations at startup, correlation between SUT logs and TAS logs using timestamps or correlation IDs. |

Test logs should enable test **replayability**, especially for random or unstable test cases.

### 6.1.2 Analyze Data from the Test Automation Solution and the System Under Test to Better Understand Results

After execution, results must be analyzed to determine causes of failure — whether they’re from the SUT or the TAS.

#### Steps to analyze failures:
1. Check if the failure is known (compare with previous runs).

2. Identify the test case and the step where it failed.

3. Check logs, screenshots, API/network traces to confirm the expected result.

4. If it's a SUT issue, report a defect and attach evidence.

5. If the test environment was unstable, analyze logs for system outages.

6. If the test results match expectations but failure is still logged, there may be an error in the TAS.

#### Additional tools:
- **Correlation IDs** (trace IDs) help follow complete interactions through multiple systems.

- **Environment analysis** includes CPU/RAM usage, browser variability, and cluster distribution.

### 6.1.3 Explain How a Test Progress Report is Constructed and Published

Test logs are not enough for stakeholder communication, structured reports are needed.

#### A good test progress report includes:
- Pass/fail status and reasons for failure.

- SUT version, configuration, and test environment details.

- Test execution history and who reported the failed test.

- Test history (useful for regression tracking).

- Issue ownership and follow-up details to fix the issue.

#### Publishing options:
- Upload to cloud/on-premise dashboards.

- Attach to tools (test management, bug tracking).

- Share via emails or chatbot alerts.

#### Audience-specific reporting:

| Stakeholder Type | Roles | Focus |
|------------------|-------|-------|
| **Management** | <li>Solution/Enterprise architect.<li>Project/delivery manager.<li>Program manager.<li>Test manager or test director. | Trend analysis, pass/fail ratios, regression frequency. |
| **Operations** | <li>Product owner/manager.<li>Business representative.<li>Business analyst. | Product health, usage stats. |
| **Technical** | <li>Team leader.<li>Scrum Master.<li>Web administrator.<li>DB Dev/Admin.<li>Test leader.<li>TAE, tester or dev. | Detailed failures, execution data, root causes. |

#### Dashboards and tools:
- Use charts, graphs, and color coding (e.g., red = fail).

- Aggregate logs from pipelines, repositories, and project tools.

- Highlight test reliability, defect clusters, and SUT performance trends.

Some tools use **AI/ML** to detect flaky tests, broken locators, and automate log analysis to reduce time spent investigating failures.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- Collect data from multiple sources (TAS, SUT, CI, and environment) to support analysis and reporting.
- Logs must capture detailed, time-based, and reproducible info for root cause analysis.
- Analysis identifies if failures are due to known issues, TAS bugs, or environment problems.
- Test reports must be adapted to the audience: technical, business, and management.
- Dashboards and ML-powered tools help surface trends and improve decision-making.

> ✅ **A solid logging and reporting strategy increases visibility and helps detect and fix issues faster.**
---
> ⚠️ **Lack of traceability, unclear logs, or missing data will slow down root cause analysis and defect resolution.**
