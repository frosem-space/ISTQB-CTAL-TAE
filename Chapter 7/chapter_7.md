## 7.1 Verification of the Test Automation Infrastructure

### 7.1.1 Plan to Verify the Test Automation Environment Including Test Tool Setup

Verifying that TAS functions as expected requires a structured verification plan that includes the environment, tools, and infrastructure.

This process should be done **before automation begins** and during ongoing maintenance.

#### **Test tool installation, setup, configuration, and customization**

Ensure test tools, function libraries, configuration files, and add-ons are installed properly. This includes:
- Verifying version consistency.

- Using automated scripts or standardized installation procedures.

- Managing updates through version control repositories.

#### **Repeatability in setup/teardown of the test environment**

The TAS must be deployable across different systems (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, local environments) with consistent behavior. This requires:
- Reliable setup scripts and teardown procedures.

- Configuration management for components and environments.

- Documentation of all TAS elements for changes and dependencies.

#### **Connectivity Validation**

Before executing tests:
- Validate access to internal/external systems and interfaces.

- Log into servers, launch tools, and verify configuration settings.

- Check permissions and ensure logging/reporting channels are working.

#### **TAF Component Testing**

Each part of the TAF must be tested independently:
- Functional checks for object recognition, data handling, and script execution.

- Non-functional checks (e.g., performance, resource usage).

- Watch for memory leaks, incorrect logging, and integration issues.

A verified setup ensures the TAS is stable, scalable, and ready to support automation efficiently.

### 7.1.2 Explain the Correct Behavior for a Given Automated Test Script and/or Test Suite

The automated test suite must be complete, consistent, reliable, maintainable, and aligned with the current version of both the TAS and the SUT.

#### **Good Practices for Verification**

| **Practice** | **Verification** |
|---|---|
| **Check the composition of the test suite** | <li>All test cases include expected results and required data.<li>The test suite version matches the SUT and TAS versions. |
| **Verifying new tests that focus on new features of the TAF** | New test cases using recently added TAF features must be tested carefully to detect early integration problems. |
| **Consider the repeatability of tests** | A test case should always return the same result when the system hasn't changed. If not, investigate causes like race conditions or timing issues. Unreliable tests should be flagged and isolated. |
| **Consider the intrusiveness of automated test tools** | Automation tools often integrate tightly with the SUT, which might alter system behavior: <ul><br><li>Overly intrusive TAS may cause performance changes or non-representative results.<li>Developers may require that test failures be replicated manually for verification. |

Maintaining a clean and consistent suite builds confidence in automated results and supports faster debugging.

### 7.1.3 Identify Where Test Automation Produces Unexpected Results

Unexpected results in automation, a root cause analysis must be performed.

#### **Root Cause Analysis Steps**:

1. **Inspect logs** from the test case, SUT, and TAF.

2. **Check test setup/teardown** to ensure environment conditions are stable.

3. **Execute isolated tests** to determine if the issue is systemic or intermittent.

4. **Verify assertions**: missing or incorrect assertions may produce unclear results.

5. **Monitor system resources**: CPU, RAM, and network usage may help identify hidden issues.

6. **Debug manually** if needed and involve:
   - Business/Test analysts
   - Developers/system engineers

Automated results are only trustworthy if traceable and reproducible.

### 7.1.4 Explain How Static Analysis Can Aid Test Automation Code Quality

Static analysis inspects code without executing it, helping detect defects early in the development process, this includes both the SUT and the TAS/TAF.

#### **Benefits of Static Analysis for Test Automation**:

- Detects:
  - Vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded credentials in test scripts).

  - Bad coding practices (e.g., inefficient loops, missing error handling).

  - Violations of coding standards and naming conventions.

- Provides:
  - Severity levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

  - Suggested fixes for known patterns.

  - Recommendations for improved resource handling (e.g., better memory management, cleanup routines).

- Supports:
  - DevSecOps practices by integrating in CI pipelines.

  - Compliance with security and maintainability standards.

  - Languages commonly used in automation (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.).

Even though automation scripts are not shipped to production, code gaps in automation code quality introduces **security risks** and **maintenance burdens**. For example, leaving sensitive data in code can be a critical vulnerability.

Extending static analysis to test automation code improves both security and long-term scalability.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- The TAS and TAF must be verified through structured setup, connectivity, and component checks.
- Automated test suites must be reliable, complete, and consistent to ensure confidence.
- Failures in automation should be traced systematically across test, environment, and code layers.
- Static analysis helps maintain secure, efficient, and compliant automation code.
- Strong verification practices increase trust in automated testing and reduce long-term costs.
