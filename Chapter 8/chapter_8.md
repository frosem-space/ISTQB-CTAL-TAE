## 8.1 Continuous Improvement Opportunities for Test Automation

### 8.1.1 Discover Opportunities for Improving Test Cases Through Data Collection and Analysis

Improving automated test cases is possible by analyzing data patterns and using various tools.

#### **Examples of analysis methods**:
- **Test histogram**: Visually shows trends across test runs, including frequent failures, fragile test cases, and unmaintained scripts.

- **AI-supported tools**: Detect changes in UI locators and apply self-healing to update test scripts automatically.

- **Schema validation**: Ensures API responses and database values match expected structure and types. It reduces the need to write many assertions and helps identify contract violations.

This approach shortens code, highlights weak tests, and increases detection of backend errors.

### 8.1.2 Analyze the Technical Aspects of a Deployed Test Automation Solution and Provide Recommendations for Improvement

A deployed TAS can be improved in several areas to reduce maintenance effort, increase efficiency, or add features.

#### Areas to evaluate and improve:

| Area | Examples of Improvement |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Scripting** | Avoid duplicated steps, use functions/libraries, apply better techniques like keyword-driven. |
| Failure recovery | Ensure tests resume after SUT or TAS failures. Add error handling and recovery logic. |
| Wait mechanisms | Replace hard waits with dynamic polling or event subscriptions. Always include timeout logic. |
| **Test execution** | Parallelize tests, split suites, and remove duplicates. Use scheduling to run tests consistently. |
| **Verification** | Use reusable and parameterized verification functions to avoid redundancy. |
| **TAA/TAF** | Adjust architecture or upgrade libraries when needed. Pilot before full update and coordinate versioning. |
| **Setup/teardown** | Move repeated code to shared methods. Handle preconditions and cleanup via APIs. |
| **Documentation** | Keep TAS usage, structure, logs, and reports well documented. |
| **TAS features** | Add only useful features that simplify work. Don’t add features just because tools offer them. |
| **TAF Upgrades** | Validate compatibility before updating TAF or tools. Run sample tests from various environments and projects. |

Improvement decisions should be based on which changes provide the most value and lowest risk.

### 8.1.3 Restructure the Automated Testware to Align with System Under Test Updates

As the SUT evolves, the TAS and testware must be updated to avoid performance and reliability issues.

#### Actions to align TAS with SUT:

- Evaluate changes in environment components (e.g., libraries, OS).

- Make small changes and verify with limited runs before full rollout.

- Regression tests to confirm no new issues were introduced.

- Optimize core libraries to improve performance or replace inefficient logic.

- Consolidate similar functions acting on UI controls to reduce maintenance.

- Refactor TAA based on new SUT features or capabilities.

- Apply consistent naming standards.

- Remove outdated or unused test scripts. Split large tests into smaller, manageable ones.

Changes should be planned, measured, and implemented with controlled impact.

### 8.1.4 Summarize Opportunities for Use of Test Automation Tools

Automation can support more than just test execution. It can also improve setup, reporting, and cleanup.

#### Examples:
- **Environment setup and control**  
  Use automation to create or clean test users, call APIs for test setup, or clean environments after runs.

- **Data aging**  
  Automatically adjust or reset data (e.g., dates in databases) to match valid test scenarios.

- **Screenshots and video generation**  
  Capture visual evidence during test execution. These assets can support debugging or be used in release notes and product demos.

Well-implemented automation helps testing teams move faster while keeping environments controlled and stable.

---

## Summary of Concepts

- Use test result patterns (e.g., histograms, schema mismatches) to identify and improve weak test cases.
- A deployed TAS should be monitored and upgraded based on usage, performance, and integration needs.
- The testware must evolve along with the SUT, but changes should be controlled and validated.
- Test automation can be used for setup, cleanup, monitoring, and generating supporting content for both testing and business use.
