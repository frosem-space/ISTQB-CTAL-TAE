## 5.1 Integration to CI/CD Pipelines

### 5.1.1 Apply Test Automation at Different Test Levels within Pipelines

One benefit of test automation is the ability to run tests automatically inside **CI/CD pipelines**. These pipelines can trigger tests during build or deployment phases depending on the test level.

#### Common automation stages in pipelines:

| Test Level | Purpose | Phase |
|------------|---------|-------|
| **Configuration tests** | Validate that paths, scripts, and files in the TAS/TAF are correctly set up. | Build |
| **Component tests** | Run on individual components like classes or UI elements. Act as quality gates. | Build |
| **Component integration tests** | Validate interactions between low-level components or parts of the SUT. | Build |
| **System tests** | Validate the entire SUT before or after deployment. | Deployment |
| **System integration tests** | Ensure that separately developed systems are working together. | Deployment |

#### Two options for system-level test integration:

In case of system integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.

1. **During deployment**  
   - Tests act as quality gates.  
   - If tests fail, deployment is rolled back.  
   - Downside: redeployment is needed to rerun failed tests.

2. **After deployment (separate pipeline)**  
   - Allows different suites to run per release.  
   - Tests don’t block deployment; rollback must be manual.

In both approaches, small automated checks (deployment verifications) can confirm the SUT is accessible, even if they don’t validate full functionality.

#### Pipelines also support:
- **Nightly test runs** for long regression suites.

- **Non-functional testing**, like performance efficiency, to monitor quality characteristics periodically.

### 5.1.2 Explain Configuration Management for Testware

Test automation must handle **multiple environments and versions** of the SUT, so configuration management is essential.

#### Main configuration elements:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Test environment configuration** | Includes environment-specific data like URLs, credentials. Often stored in testware, can be part of the common core library or shared repositories. |
| **Test data** | May differ by environment or SUT feature set or release. Can be stored in smaller TAFs or test data management tools. |
| **Test suites / Test cases** | Grouped by purpose (e.g., smoke, regression) and aligned to test levels. Suites can be triggered by environment or feature toggles. |

#### Versioning strategies:

- Use **feature toggles** to decide which tests run per environment or release.
- **Testware versions** should match SUT versions using tags or branches in version control.

---

### 5.1.3 Explain Test Automation Dependencies for an API Infrastructure

In API testing, understanding and managing dependencies is key for building a proper strategy.

#### Key dependencies:

- **API connections**  
  Understand business logic, know what APIs interact and what logic is handled by each. Understand dependencies between endpoints.

- **API documentation**  
  Use official docs for request/response details, headers, and parameters. This ensures tests are aligned with expected behavior.

#### Contract Testing

Is a type of integration testing, a **contract** defines how services interact and validates compatibility. Contract testing verifies if an API (provider) meets the expectations of its consumer and the data shared between the services is consistent with a specified set of rules.

| Contract Type | Ownership | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Consumer-driven** | Defined by the consumer | Specifies how the provider must respond. |
| **Provider-driven** | Defined by the provider | Describes what the service exposes and how it behaves. |

**Benefits of contract testing:**
- Validates integration at the API level early.

- Detects incompatible changes quickly.

- Captures and stores interactions for verification.

Recommended for **microservices** and large distributed systems where services evolve independently.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- Pipelines should integrate automated tests across all test levels, acting as quality gates.
- Choose execution timing based on rollback strategy and test type (build vs deploy).
- Configuration management ensures automation adapts to different SUT versions and environments.
- API automation must consider dependencies, documentation, and compatibility.
- Contract testing ensures integration across services remains stable and evolvable.

> ✅ **A well integrated pipeline and proper config management are crucial for reliable automation delivery.**

> ⚠️ **Ignoring API dependencies or bad testware versioning can lead to unstable results and failed releases.**
